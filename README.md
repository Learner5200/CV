## Chris Cooksley

I'm a **full stack web developer** proficient in **Ruby** and **JavaScript**, currently moving fast and making things at Makers' intensive 16-week bootcamp. I'm looking for a role with interesting challenges where I can grow my programming knowledge.
Before Makers I studied cognitive science at Cambridge University (BA Natural Sciences) and UCL (MSc Cognitive and Decision Sciences), where I learnt to code behavioural experiments in **Python**. I also solved problems for Cancer Research UK as a strategy intern. I'm excited to finally be using my analytical skills to build software, and look forward to making a living from it.

## Skills

#### Programming languages, frameworks and methodologies

- **Object oriented programming** using JavaScript, Python, Ruby
- **Full-stack web development** with Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript
- **Test-driven development** with Jasmine, RSpec, Capybara
- **Data analysis** with R and Python
- **Pair Programming** and **Agile** team processes

#### Problem Solving

- I pride myself on my ability to clearly define a problem, break it down into logical constituents, and systematically investigate and address each part.
- I developed this skill as a Strategy Intern for Cancer Research UK, where I analysed access to surgery and radiotherapy for UK cancer patients, and as a Philosophy undergraduate at Cambridge, where I devised novel solutions to thorny philosophical problems each week.
- I have honed it at Makers, where I have developed a strong debugging process to confront new challenges daily.

#### Fast Learner

- Before Makers, I have a long history of quickly learning new and challenging topics (analytic philosophy, neuroscience, statistics), and applying that knowledge to great success (the highest possible grade in every academic field I have entered).
- My time at Makers has pushed me not only to learn  software engineering concepts at an incredible rate (e.g. I wrote a [web app](https://github.com/Learner5200/bowling-challenge) in JavaScript after 4-5 days of learning), but to take ownership of my learning by explicitly tracking progress towards my intellectual goals.

#### Communication

- Before Makers, I delivered first-class written work to deadline in diverse disciplines (Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience), tailored engaging presentations to diverse audiences (charity clients, academics, sixth-formers), and led brilliant teams to success in diverse settings (fundraising at Cancer Research UK, pitching behavioural science interventions to clients of Ogilvy UK)
- During my [team](https://github.com/rbbri/makersbnb) [projects](https://github.com/Learner5200/acebook-MAICers) at Makers, I have used agile methodologies to develop lean software under tight time constraints. In the process, I have learned the importance of frequent, forthright and face-to-face communication of knowledge, needs and ideas to my teammates.

## Interests

Love cooking for anyone that will eat it, and eating anything people will cook for me. Big fan of London's street food markets, food science, 'gastrophysics' (look it up!) and Serious Eats.

Recently taken up Dungeons & Dragons, and loving every moment of it. Currently a Loremaster Wizard. Find me at the London Dungeons & Dragons meetup.

Wandering round Hampstead Heath. Always very excited to meet other people's dogs.
