## Chris Cooksley

I'm currently learning the essentials of software development with Makers Academy, London, on their intensive 16-week fellowship program. Before joining Makers I completed an MSc in Behavioural Science and worked for Cancer Research UK as a strategy intern. I'm excited to finally be using my analytical skills to build things, and look forward to making a living from it four months from now.

## Skills

#### Programming languages and frameworks

- Achieved basic proficiency with **Ruby** and **Rails** in preparation for Makers Academy; used these to build a Pinterest clone. Plan to develop these skills during the Makers bootcamp.
- Learned **Python** during my MSc at University College London; used it to program an interactive experimental game with a custom physics engine, among other projects
- Used **R** throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees for data analysis
- Learned the basics of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** using freeCodeCamp

#### Problem Solving

I pride myself on my ability to clearly define a problem, break it down into logical constituents (following the MECE principle), and systematically investigate and address each part while keeping an eye on the big picture.

- At Cancer Research UK, I conducted a strategic analysis of problems with cancer treatment access in the UK. I created structured tree of hypotheses, planned and conducted multimodal research into each, presented practical recommendations to senior stakeholders.
- In my two years studying philosophy at Cambridge, it was my weekly task to confront a thorny problem in logic or analytic philosophy, develop a clear mental model of it, and craft a coherent, persuasive solution. My ability to do this earned me the highest grades in the year two years running.

#### Communication

Throughout my academic and non-academic career I have made it a priority to hone my written and verbal communication skills.

- I have presented first-class written work to deadline in multiple disciplines (Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience), including cutting-edge literature reviews, development of original arguments, logical structuring and eloquent explanation.
- I have delivered and tailored presentations to various audiences: e.g. pitching behavioural interventions to clients of Ogilvy Consulting; teaching Harrow students the contemporary philosophy of free will; defending my written work to senior academics each week at Cambridge


#### Teamwork

I've had the good fortune to work in many diverse and brilliant teams in a variety of settings, and to learn how I can best help them thrive.

- While at Cancer Research UK I worked with a team of interns to develop and deliver a series of fundraising events. I directed meetings, organised the logistics and gave constructive feedback.
- I worked with two teams on Ogilvy's Behavioural Science summer school to design and pitch a set of behavioural interventions for a social enterprise combatting loneliness in seniors

## Interests

Love cooking for anyone that will eat it, and eating anything people will cook for me. Big fan of London's street food markets, food science, 'gastrophysics' (look it up!) and Serious Eats.

Recently taken up Dungeons & Dragons, and loving every moment of it. Currently a Tempest Cleric. Find me at the London Dungeons & Dragons meetups.

Wandering round Hampstead Heath. Always very excited to meet other people's dogs.
