## Chris Cooksley

I'm currently learning the essentials of software development with Makers Academy, London, via their intensive 16-week fellowship program. Before joining Makers I completed an MSc in Behavioural Science and worked for Cancer Research UK as a strategy intern. I'm excited to finally be using my analytical skills to build things, and look forward to making a living from it.

## Interests

Love cooking for anyone that will eat it, and eating anything people will cook for me. Big fan of London's street food markets, food science, 'gastrophysics' (look it up!) and Serious Eats.

Recently taken up Dungeons & Dragons, and loving every moment of it. Currently a Tempest Cleric. Find me at the London Dungeons & Dragons meetups.

Wandering round Hampstead Heath. Always very excited to meet other people's dogs.
